Project Happy Thoughts API - https://project-happy-thoughts-api-5u3xa3b6hq-lz.a.run.app/

🏁 Goals:

The goal with this project was to build an API which includes both GET request endpoints to return data and POST endpoints to create data.

Must-have requirements:

✅ The API should implement the routes exactly as documented.

✅ The GET /thoughts endpoint should only return 20 results, ordered by createdAt in descending order.

✅ The API should validate user input and return appropriate errors if the input is invalid.

✅ In the POST /thoughts endpoint to create a new thought, if the input was invalid and the API is returning errors, it should set the response status to 400 (bad request).

✅ The endpoint to add hearts to a thought should return an appropriate error if the thought was not found.

🚧 The problem:

I started on the structure of the backend and the API and built from there. 

I think this was good project and am very pleased with it in the end. I managed everything I set out to do.
